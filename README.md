Introduction to C programming language

## Foreword
This short introduction to C programming language is meant to be high-paced course to grasp key concepts of this kind and unforgiving language.
It does not explain most basic concepts of programming, but rather explains in what form they are present in C.
Also this course is not focused on optimal
and high-performance code wiriting. It you are looking for this, go look somewhere else.

## Organisation
Course is grouped into several list of tasks and exercises, each with some questions to answer. Those questions relate to key concepts of particular exercise. If you do not understand something or think "I will never need this..." - don't, those concepts are so essential that it is almost always present in some form or other. Extra questions will be marked as such.

Oh.. for developer environment I'll just use gcc on some linux distro. If you use Windows then it's actually your problem.
