# `02. Functions & Pointers`
*"Write function for this... Write function for that..."*

## `Ex 01. "Something about functions"`

Copy code from below and modify it accroding to nex exercises.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void foo(int a) {
  printf("%d at %p\n", a, &a);
  a += 10;
  printf("%d at %p\n", a, &a); 
}


int main() {
  int a = 10;
  printf("%d at %p\n", a, &a);
  
  foo(a);
  
  printf("%d at %p\n", a, &a);
  
  return 0;
}

```

**Questions:**
1. What do you observe?
2. How this might be crutial in the future?
3. Pass-by-copy vs pass-by-value, what are the differences?


## `Ex 02. "More about functions..."`

Modify code from previous exercise to pass the string (char[]) instead of int.

**Questions:**
1. What are the differences?
2. Is it possible to view modification made inside the function from outside?


## `Ex 03. "More about adresses..."`

Declare array of `int` of length 10, print address of each of element.

**Questions:**
1. What is the distance between each value (in bytes)?
2. Can you write a custom value to the spaces between the distance?
3. Can you write the value of each cell (this will behave like array of length 4 * 10)?

## `Ex 03. "Malloc'ate some space"`
Use malloc to allocate array of custom length of type `char`. Write some text into it (ex. `scanf()`). Print this value into the terminal.
Now split each of those actions into separate function (`allocate_memory()`, `read_input()`, `print_value()`)

**Questions:**
1. How would you understand the term "pointer to pointer" ie. ** symbol?
2. What is the size of pointer type? Is it the same for all types (`char`, `int` etc.)?
3. Why the size of pointer is exaclty this big? What would happen on older OS and machines ?
4. Did you remember to free the allocated memory? What are the consequences of not doing so?
5. What is `(void*)`?

## `Ex 04. "I'm pointing at..."`

Write a simple function that prints the numeric values in hex, of blocks of n bytes of an array.
Function should work for every type of data (`int`, `char` etc.).
```C
int print_table(void* p, size_t block_size);
```

Example:
For `int t[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; print_table(t, 4);` prints `0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 ....`
