# `03. Some practice`
*"Let's recap..."*

## `Ex 01. "What about adding big numbers?"`

Write function `int add(char* a, int len_a, char* b, int len_b, char** c)` that adds two large numbers (larger than `long long int`).
It will be best if the operation of adding will be performed like in the addition done by hand on the paper i.e. adding from last ciphers to the most significant with carry.
Note that output should be under `c` and if the length of sum is larger than `len` then `c` should have adequate length to hold whole number.
Function should return the number of bytes that the return number holds.

Example of use:
```C
  ...
  char a[] = {0, 0, 0, 1};
  char b[] = {0, 0, 0, 2};
  int len = 4;
  char* c;
  int out_len = add(a, b, &c, 4); 
  // out_len should hold "4"  
  ...
```

**Questions:**
1. What do you observe?
2. How this might be crutial in the future?
3. Pass-by-copy vs pass-by-value, what are the differences?


## `Ex 02. "What about multiplying big numbers?"`

Write function similar to the one above, but multiplying `a` and `b`.
`int mult(char* a, char* b, char** c, int len)`

## `Ex 03. "Factorial"`

Use functions from `Ex 01.` and `Ex 02.` to calculate the 100!. And print the result using function from list no. 2.
