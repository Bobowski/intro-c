# `04. Structures`
*"Structures... so many..."*

## `Ex 01. "Intro to struct"`

Create structure `bar` that has three fields of type int, int * and int[10]. In `main()` initialize values to {10, 5, {1, 2, ...10}}.
Pass this structure to function `foo(struct bar b)` and inside assigne new custom values.
Again in `main()` print values from structure. What do you observe, how the structures are passed to functions?

## `Ex 02. "Vector"`
Create structure `Vector3` of three dimentions `x, y, z` of type `float`, and define funtions 
`Vector3 add(Vector3 a, Vector3 b)`,
`Vector3 scalar_mult(Vector3 a, float a)`,
`Vector3 dot_product(Vector3 a, Vector3 b)`,
`Vector3 cross_product(Vector3 a, Vector3 b)`.

Additionaly write function `bool equal(Vector3 a, Vector3 b)` that return true (or 1 in `int`) while the two vectors are aproximately the same.
Let's say that `eps = 0.001`. If have any questions about why doing so, read about floating point representation and comparison.

## `Ex 03. "Character"

Write a structure `Character` that has multiple sub structures inside: `Armor, Weapon, SpellBook`.

``` C
struct Armor {
  int defense;
  int durability;
  int weight;
};

struct Weapon {
  int damage;
  int durability;
  int weigth;
};

struct Spell {
  char[] name;
  int mana_cost;
  int damage;
}

struct SpellBook {
  int weight;
  Spell[] spells;
}

```

Combine the structures into character, add his name `char[30]` and other properties that you might want.
Initialize two different characters that share the same `Armor`, `Weapon` na `SpellBook` objects, that is, if changed in one of them, the second has changes too.
(Hint: pointer to structures)
