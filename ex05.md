# `05. Linked list`
*"Single  linked list... double linked list..."*

## `Ex 01. "Linked list"`

The idea of linekd list it to have a structure that holds the list of `n` elements but in such way that frequent manipulations of adding and deleting elements in the middle of list is relatively cheap.
Implement single (forward) linked list with following operations:
1. `add(Node** root, Node* node)` - adds new node in the incrementing order.
2. `Node* find(Node** root, int value)` - return node with equal value or `NULL` if none present.
3. `Node* delete_node(Node** root, Node* node) - delete node and return it
4. `Node* delete_value(Node** root, int value) - find node of given value and delete it, `NULL` if value not present.

The program should read from I/O number of nodes and its values, then create the list in sorted order. It can be done while reading values (read value from input -> create node -> add node to list -> read value from ...).
Then ask how many and which values to delete, delete them and write list in new order.

```C
struct Node {
  int value
  struct Node* next;
}
```

Example I/O:
``` bash
$ ./single_linked
Number of nodes: 5
7
2
5
1
0
Thanks! Ordered list has: 
0, 1, 2, 5, 7
Number of values to delete: 2
2
0
Ok, new list:
1, 5, 7
```

## `Ex 01. "Double Linked list"`

```C
struct Node {
  int value
  struct Node* next;
  struct Node* prev;
}
```

Do the same as for the single linked list, with double linked list. 
Keep also the pointer on the end of the list (`struct Node* end`), and while printing the values of list, print also in reverse order.
